Hi.

This is a very nice file.

Why is this file here, you ask?

Well, I don't really know either.

Apparently this is some sort of introduction file for my profile.

So, uh, hi. I'm [REDACTED]. I go to [REDACTED] School, and I'm 16 years old. 

Below is some stuff about me I got inspired to write by Beter.

I got interested in coding when I was about 7 years old and discovered Scratch. 
I like coding because of its close ties with math and general problem-solving.
I plan to, at some point in the future, create a rhythm game with my coding skills. This is because I have a large interest in rhythm games.
Other things I have a large interest in are literature, math, Minecraft, and music. I'm also a furry. So uh, that's cool I guess.

My website is phoenixhunter.carrd.co. It has everything I've put online from my Twitter to my YouTube.
It's probably not a great idea to put this where people from my school might be able to find me, but it's ok.
I'm not a fan of hiding who you are for the approval of superficial and judgmental people.

I'll probably edit this later to have some cool markdown stuff and GIFs and stuff. But for now, this is all you get.

See ya.
